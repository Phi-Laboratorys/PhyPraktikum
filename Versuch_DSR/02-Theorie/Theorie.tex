\chapter{Theoretical background}

With saturation spectroscopy enables us to see the hyperfine structure, because with this methode it is theoretical possible to bypass the dopplereffect. \\
By saturation spectroscopy a laser (pump beam) beam will pass a gas sample (with doppler widened absorption transitions). That caused a stimulation of specific atoms, depending from there speed. 

Vice versa to the pump beam another laser beam with the same frequency (probe beam) will also pass the gas sample.

If now a photon is absorbed, the atom must have a speed component ($v_z$ parallel to the laser beams) in the intervall: 
\begin{align}
    v_{\text{z}} \pm \Delta v_{\text{z}} = \frac{\omega -\omega_0 \pm \delta \omega_{\text{n}}}{k}
\end{align}
In this connection: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item $\delta \omega_{\text{n}}$ is the homogeneous line width.
    \item $\Delta v_{\text{z}}$ is the width of the hole in the occupation distribution.
    \item $\omega$ is the frequency of the laser.
    \item $\omega_0$ is the resonance frequency of the wanted transition.
    \item $k$ 
\end{itemize}
