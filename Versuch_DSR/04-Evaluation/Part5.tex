\section{Hyperfine constant}
In the following we use the equation \ref{eq:HFS} to calculate the hyperfine constants.
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:HFS}
    \Delta E_{HFS} = \frac{a}{2} [F(F+1) - J(J+1) - I(I+1)]
\end{align}
We know the Energy difference from ground state and the Quantum numbers of the transitions. So we can rewrite the equation: 
\begin{align}
    a = \frac{2(\Delta E_2 - \Delta E_1)}{F_2(F_2+1)-F_1(F_1+1)}
\end{align}
